Between 2008 and 2016 this site was dedicated to telling a story about connected health data using emerging technologies. Regretfully, after a lengthy hiatus I lost access to all site files.

Currently, runningdigital.com is a landing page for my socials. Reach out to me using the icons under my avatar on the root URL with Twitter, YouTube or email.
